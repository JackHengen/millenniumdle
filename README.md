# Millenniumdle

This is a game I made senior year of high school for guessing the teachers at Millennium. You guess their name and it tells you which aspects (such as hair color, subject, and grade) you got correct. 
Im pretty proud of it as I benefitted off of the hype of Wordle at the type and made a product which kids at my school were intrested to use.

I had huge aspirations for this game, including...

- A datalist to autofill teacher names, you could have never had the teacher which was chosen as the answer or forgot how to spell their name, so this is a very important feature.
- A way to choose the year
- Daily mode
- A student guessing mode fetching data from students on other students to insert them in the game
  
Unfortunately I never found the time and the school year quickly ended. The game came out too late and I felt uninspired knowing my work would die out and go to waste.
